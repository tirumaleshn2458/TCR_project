# Project title: Cancer death rate prediction
## Project description

### Cancer death rate prediction
This is a project in my first internship. The project aims to predict the chances of death for a cancer patient. I took the dataset from kaggle.com. I have performed all the necessary steps to showcase how the dataset I took is adequate for the ML model used to predict. I also analysed the graphs to check out the frequencies of specific values in every feature.

Pipelines: 
Exploratory Data Analysis
Feature engineering
Feature selection
Model training

ML models used:
Lasso Regression for feature selection
Linear Regression for training and testing the ML model.
